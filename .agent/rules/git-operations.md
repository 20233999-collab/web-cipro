# CIPRO AI Rules & Guidelines

## 🛡️ Git & GitHub Operations (CRITICAL)
- **NO AUTOMATIC COMMITS**: Never execute `git commit` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **NO AUTOMATIC TAGS**: Never execute `git tag` unless explicitly instructed with a specific tag name or milestone.
- **NO AUTOMATIC PUSHES**: Always wait for the user to say "Sube los cambios" or "Push the changes" before executing `git push`.
- **Manual Control**: The user prefers to have full control over the repository history.
